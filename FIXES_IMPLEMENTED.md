# Voice Agent Fixes - Implementation Log

## âœ… Issue #1: Double/Repeated Responses - COMPLETED

### Problem
When handling KYC queries, the bot sent multiple acknowledgment messages:
1. First response: "Pareshani ke liye maafi chahungi, kaise sahayata kar sakti hun main aapki?"
2. Tool execution (classify_customer_intent, load_instructions_for_intent)
3. Second response: "Haan sir main samajh pa rhi hun. Ap nishchint rahiye, main aapki puri sahayata karungi."
4. Third response: Similar reassurance again

### Root Cause
- **Instruction conflict**: Base agent instructions contained generic reassurance phrases
- **Tool loading behavior**: After loading intent-specific instructions, LLM generated new responses based on newly loaded context
- **Missing consolidation enforcement**: Silent multi-tool execution rule wasn't strict enough

### Implementation Details

#### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `src/agent.py` (Base Agent Instructions)**
   - **Lines 90-97**: Added explicit CRITICAL instruction to prevent responses after tool calls
   ```
   **CRITICAL**: After calling `classify_customer_intent` and `load_instructions_for_intent`:
   - DO NOT send an acknowledgment message like "Haan sir main samajh pa rhi hun, Ap nishchint rahiye..."
   - DO NOT generate any response text before the tools complete
   - Proceed DIRECTLY with the next step in the loaded instruction flow
   - The loaded instructions will tell you exactly what to say next
   ```

   - **Lines 174-181**: Removed generic reassurance phrase from conversational guide
   ```diff
   - When helping: "Ap nishchint rahiye, main aapki puri sahayata karungi"
   + DO NOT use generic reassurances like "Ap nishchint rahiye" - the loaded instructions will handle specific consolation
   + After classifying intent and loading instructions, proceed DIRECTLY with the loaded flow
   ```

2. **Updated `data/Instructions/Enhanced_KYC_Approval_Contractor.txt`**
   - **Lines 4-9**: Modified STEP 1 to skip redundant greeting
   ```
   **STEP 1: INITIAL GREETING (ALREADY DONE - SKIP IF IN PROGRESS)**
   - The base agent has already greeted with "Namaste, welcome to Birla Opus..."
   - DO NOT repeat greeting or send generic acknowledgments like "Aap nishchint rahiye"
   - You are now in the KYC flow - the customer has already explained their KYC issue
   - Use brief acknowledgments only: 'Ji', 'Haan', 'Theek hai' when needed
   - DO NOT send separate reassurance messages - integrate everything into consolidated responses
   ```

   - **Lines 11-13**: Streamlined STEP 2 to proceed directly
   ```
   **STEP 2: PHONE NUMBER VERIFICATION (IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP)**
   Customer's issue is related to KYC/contractor approval. Proceed directly:
   - ASK ONCE: 'Kya aap apne registered mobile number se call kar rahe hain?'
   ```

   - **Lines 94-99**: Consolidated consolation into information delivery (STEP 10)
   ```diff
   - Console customer: 'Nishchint rahiye, hamari team jald se jald aapki madad karegi'
   + Include brief consolation WITHIN the information delivery, not as separate message
   + Example: 'Main aapke liye complaint create kar di hun. Aapka complaint number hai [X], 7 din mein resolve hogi. Team jald se jald aapki madad karegi.'
   ```

   - **Lines 116-128**: Updated CRITICAL RULES
   ```
   1. DO NOT send multiple separate messages - consolidate everything into single responses
   2. DO NOT repeat generic reassurances like "Aap nishchint rahiye" - this was already said
   12. MINIMIZE acknowledgment messages - get straight to the point
   ```

3. **Updated `data/Instructions/KYC_Approval_Pending_Contractor.txt`**
   - **Line 96**: Consolidated consolation message
   ```diff
   - Console customer: "Nishchint rahiye, hamari team jald se jald aapki madad karegi"
   + Include brief consolation within the information delivery: "Team jald se jald aapki madad karegi"
   ```

### Expected Behavior After Fix

**Before:**
```
USER: "Mujhe KYC karvani hai"
AGENT: "Haan sir, main samajh pa rhi hun."
AGENT: "Ap nishchint rahiye, main aapki puri sahayata karungi."
AGENT: "Kya aap apne registered mobile number se call kar rahe hain?"
```

**After:**
```
USER: "Mujhe KYC karvani hai"
AGENT: "Ji. Kya aap apne registered mobile number se call kar rahe hain?"
```

### Files Modified
- `src/agent.py` (Lines 90-97, 174-181)
- `data/Instructions/Enhanced_KYC_Approval_Contractor.txt` (Lines 4-9, 11-13, 94-99, 116-128)
- `data/Instructions/KYC_Approval_Pending_Contractor.txt` (Line 96)

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test KYC approval flow with different customer queries
2. Verify no duplicate reassurances in responses
3. Check that acknowledgments are minimal and natural
4. Ensure consolation is integrated within informational messages
